# Group GitHub Practice

1. Fork this repo, then clone it to your computer.
2. Switch to the DEVELOPMENT branch and then create a branch called feature-yourFirstName (so my branch is called feature-ben)
3. On your feature branch, add a paragraph tag containing your first name to index.html
4. Commit and push your code, then create a pull request so I can merge your branch.  
5. Once your pull request has been approved, select the option to delete your branch.
6. Update your local cloned copy of the repo to the latest version by switching to the DEVELOPMENT branch in GitHub Desktop, clicking on "Current Branch" and then click at the bottom on "Choose a Branch to Merge into development".  Select "origin/development", then click the blue Merge button.
